# Multi-Step Form (Frontend Mentor)

This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). The challenge required building a multi-step form that closely resembles the provided design. In my implementation, I chose to use React, TypeScript, Tailwind and Redux Toolkit. I specifically opted for Redux Toolkit as I wanted to enhance my understanding and usage of Redux.

## Features

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update selections
- See a summary of selections on the final step and confirm the order
- View the optimal layout for different screen sizes
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
